## About Me

I'm **Ibrahim Lahlou**, an ML Engineer focused on building and maintaining production machine learning systems. My work centers on the operational aspects of ML—model serving, monitoring, and infrastructure.

I specialize in designing ML pipelines that handle real-world production challenges: data drift detection, inference optimization, and system reliability. My approach combines understanding the mathematical foundations (statistical process control, time series analysis, distribution shift theory) with hands-on implementation using modern MLOps tools.

## Technical Skills

```python
stack = {
    "serving": ["FastAPI", "BentoML", "Yatai", "Ray Serve"],
    "orchestration": ["Prefect", "Airflow"],
    "tracking": ["MLflow", "DVC"],
    "monitoring": ["Evidently AI", "Prometheus", "Grafana"],
    "infrastructure": ["GCP", "Docker", "Kubernetes"],
    "data_storage": ["MinIO", "MongoDB", "PostgreSQL", "Redis", "MySQL"],
    "automation": ["CI/CD", "GitHub Actions", "Selenium"],
    "fundamentals": ["Adaptive batching", "Drift detection", "System design"]
}
```

**Primary Focus Areas:**
- Model serving architectures and inference optimization
- Statistical drift detection and monitoring systems
- ML pipeline orchestration and automation
- Cloud infrastructure for ML workloads

## Background

**State Engineering Diploma in Data Science & Cloud Computing**
ENSA Oujda | UMP (2019-2024)

Coursework: Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, Stochastic Processes, Cloud-Native Architecture, Software Engineering, Statistics, Data Mining.

**Experience:** 2 years in MLOps engineering, building production ML systems—model serving APIs, workflow orchestration, experiment tracking, and cloud deployment on GCP.

## Writing

I document technical concepts and production challenges in ML systems:

- Time series analysis (ACF/PACF, Kalman filtering, spectral methods)
- Data drift detection (covariate shift, prior probability shift, sample selection bias)
- Neural network architectures (CNNs, convolution operations, pooling strategies)
- Inference optimization (batching strategies, processing patterns)

Posts include mathematical foundations, implementation details, and code examples.
